                    Is this a good question to ask? Seeing how it’s taken for granted, yet the personal reasons to learn more might vary from person to person, I’d say it’s a good thing to have clarity on.
                    There are multifold reasons for me to try to learn new things. I’ll summarise them below.
                    Capability — Because I can. Having studied serious theoretical physics for three years, I have encountered and understood many complex concepts about how the world works, and I am confident in my ability to understand any concept I encounter.
                    Gaining Perspectives — Learning provides you fresh perspectives about the world, and gives you power. The more knowledge you have, the better your decisions and the more self-reliant you become. You gain the ability to think for yourself, distinguish fact from fiction, and escape the herd.
                    Confidence — Learning things increases your self-worth. When you know that you are a repository of knowledge, and not some pushover that anybody can bullshit, you value yourself more.
                    Reduced friction points — Learning is extremely easy in this era. As Naval said, you have more than ten times the knowledge contained in the Library of Alexandria on your fingertips. If this were the 1900s, and I had to steal books from the library(caste issues, irrelevant now), you bet I wouldn’t make an effort to learn more than I could easily.
                    For the fun of it — I simply enjoy learning, on an unexplainable level. None of the above would have mattered, if this were not true. It’s analogous to when you love a person, the justifications for your feelings are merely reinforcing your love, and not the source of it.
                    Do tell me your reasons for learning new things. I’m sure my list could use some appendments.
