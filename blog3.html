                    Entropy means the (log of) number of microstates for any particular macrostate, where macrostate means a property of the system that you can observe, such as temperature. What this essentially means is the number of ways a system can have a particular value of some observable. Whichever macrostate has the maximum entropy is the equilibrium state of the system, which is the state the system settles down to. Interestingly enough, this concept directly carries over to our state of the mind, hence the name. The number of ways your mind diverts to any particular state is the entropy of that state. And the state with the maximum entropy becomes your equilibrium or default state.
                    In the light of this, what you want to do, is to make your highest priority state your default state. You have to increase the number of ways your mind is stimulated to be in the said state, and decrease the number of microstates available to other macrostates. This naturally leads to why social media consumption (as opposed to creation) is destructive for your brain. Every time you open Twitter, you see 50 tweets. Every time you open Instagram, you see 50 posts. Thatâ€™s 50 ways your brain is pushed away from your desired state. Now this is a problem, which I leave for you to think about. Passive learning is a bad idea, which is why I would prefer you to ponder over this problem. Try to come up with a feasible solution. Extra points if the solution is non-trivial.
